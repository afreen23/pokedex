# Pokedex
A Pokedex in a command-line REPL. 

If you're not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that's okay! 
A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.

## Usage:
```
help: Displays a help message
exit: Exit the Pokedex
map:  Displays the next 20 location areas of Pokemon world
mapb:  Displays the previous 20 location areas of Pokemon world
catch: Takes the name of a pokemon and throws a Pokeball to catch it!
 e.g: `catch pikachu`
explore:  Takes a locations and provides the list of found pokemons at that location
 e.g: `explore canalave-city-area`
inspect: Inspects a caught pokemon.
 e.g: `inspect pikachu`
pokedex: Displays all the caught pokemons.

```
