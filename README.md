# Pokedex
A Pokedex in a command-line REPL. 

Uses the Pok√©API to power all of the data we'll need. If you're not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that's okay! 
A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.

## Usage:
```
